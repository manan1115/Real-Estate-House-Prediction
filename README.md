This project is a comprehensive step-by-step guide to building a Real Estate Price Prediction web application. The primary goal is to predict housing prices in Bangalore using machine learning models. The project is divided into three major components:
## Model Building:
Using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle, we will build a predictive model with Linear Regression from scikit-learn. During this process, we will explore essential data science techniques like:
+ Data loading and preprocessing
+ Handling missing values and outlier detection/removal
+ Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction
+ Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
+ Evaluating the model with K-Fold Cross Validation
## Python Flask Server: 
Once the model is trained, we will create a Python Flask server that can serve the trained model for making real-time predictions via HTTP requests.
## Web Interface: 
The final component is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This UI allows users to input relevant features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and get a real-time prediction from the Flask server.

## Features of the Project
Data Science Techniques Covered:
+ Data Cleaning using Pandas
+ Data Visualization with Matplotlib
+ Model building and evaluation with scikit-learn
+ Dimensionality reduction and feature selection
+ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
+ Outlier detection and handling
+ K-Fold Cross Validation for model performance assessment
Web Application:
- A user-friendly web interface where users can enter house attributes like area, number of bedrooms, etc.
- The website makes AJAX requests to the Flask server for predictions in real-time.
- Simple yet functional front-end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technology Stack:

+ Python: Core programming language for model development and server-side scripting.
+ Numpy and Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
+ Matplotlib: For data visualization and exploratory analysis.
+ Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building the prediction model.
+ Flask: Lightweight web framework to serve the trained model via HTTP requests.
+ HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For front-end development of the user interface.
+ IDE/Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm for development.
